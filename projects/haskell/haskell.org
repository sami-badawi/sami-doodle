* Utility of Haskell in 2020-05

 - I think that I can use this for writing small utilities.
 - I do think that this shows me something about constructive mathematics.
 - As long as I think that it is fun and I still do.
 - I have a feeling that I will be getting tired of Haskell soon.
 - Maybe I could do another Haskell project before I run out of steam.
