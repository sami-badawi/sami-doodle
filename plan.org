This doesn't fit with GTD. But it is an overview page that is not generated.

* Purpose

 - Overview
 - Goals
 - Compare different tasks
 - Things can be split out

* Organize photos

Maybe I can also do this inside org mode.

* Code projects

** Do more Haskell

What should I do?



** Try some Emacs Lisp
 
I always wanted to learn a Lisp now I have a bit of use for it.

On the other hand I understand it well enough 

** Racket


* Math

** TODO Finish category theory video

I got pretty far.

* Setup org mode [0/2][0%]

Should I back port or just do new work here?

 - [ ] Port the most important general things
 - [ ] Port Haskell table CLI
 - [ ] Find out how to organize the projects
