** Project folder 

If I have these should there be a top index file?

I could possibly have a haskell/haskell.org file that might be better.

I think that if I turn this into a web page then I can have different type of indexes.

What happens when I return to Haskell after 3 years?

I think that it is fine that I continue with haskell/haskell.org of general things.

But when I start again I should probably make haskell/table-cli.org or haskell/haskell-ideas-2020.org.

I think that it is pretty cheap to rename and clean up.

It is good to keep notes in one place.
So when I have to get back to 

** How is this better than Google doc or Word?

 - I can see this in both Google and Windows world.
